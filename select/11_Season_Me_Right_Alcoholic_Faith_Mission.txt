Very last words
Uttered from your lips
Tore me into pieces
Threw you to the ground
Wiped me from your body
Drained me from the sheets
Still they resonate
Your very last words

Now it's surely over
Unless you bring me tea
While serving yourself up to
The queen in me

I picked on everything
You held to be the truth
I lived on my machines
Nothing's ever real
I placed you on a fruitstand
You rotted into mulch
Still they resonate
Your very last words

Unravelling before med
Handle you like meat
Serving you for entrês
The remainder of the week

Very last words
Uttered from your lips
Tore me into pieces
Threw you to the ground
Wiped me from your body
Drained me from the sheets
Still they resonate
Your very last words
