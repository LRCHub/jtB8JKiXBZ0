And the bows are there
And the hills have worn to dust
And the cool rushing waters
Have run dry
The red wine grapes
Hang withered on the wine
And gone is the songbird
From the sky

Oh it's gonna be a long dry season
Oh it's gonna be a while
Till the rainbow [?]
It's gonna be a time for believers
Until the grass is green again

Oh it's gonna be a long dry season
Oh it's gonna be a while
Till the rainbow [?]
It's gonna be a time for believers
A time to hope when hope is gone
To keep on keeping on
Until the grass is green again

Long dry season
A long dry season
(A long dry season)
